== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have a Wishpond account set up already? =

No, your account is automatically created through the plugin, or you can simply use an existing account.

= Do I need to know how to code or design? =

Not at all! Wishpond's Social Promotion builder (with optimized templates already set up for you) was created specifically so no coding or design knowledge is required.

= Can I use the Social Promotions Builder plugin for free? =

Absolutely! You can create and publish your Social Promotions for free for up to 200 leads that you get.
You can learn more about our pricing [here](https://www.wishpond.com/pricing/ "Pricing").

= Do I need to set up any Wordpress configuration options for this plugin? =

All you need is to make sure that the Permalinks are set to "Post Name" or "Custom Structure". You would verify this in Settings->Permalinks.

= Where are Social Promotions stored? =

Your Social Promotions are stored on Wishpond. This also means that if you ever uninstall this plugin, your Wishpond account still has your work.

= How do I delete a Social Promotion? =

After you create a Social Promotion, you can view it under "Dashboard". To delete it, simply select the gear icon and click "Delete".

= What URL should I use when creating a Social Promotion? =

When creating a Social Promotion you have to make sure you use the domain of the Wordpress page you are on, followed by the path at which you want the Social Promotion to be hosted. So if my Wordpress site is at "http://www.wishpond.com" (and I can see this in the address bar) and I want to host my Social Promotion at "new-social-promotion", then I would use the following url "http://www.wishpond.com/new-social-promotion".

= What if my Wordpress site is on a multisite installation? =

If your Wordpress site is hosted under a multi-site installation, then your Wordpress path would be preceeded by your site's domain. For example, if your Wordpress site is hosted at "http://www.wishpond-hosting.org/my-site/" then you can host a Social Promotion at "http://www.wishpond-hosting.org/my-site/social-promotion"

= I can't publish a Social Promotion, what's wrong? =

When editing a Social Promotion you must make sure the URL you specify begins with the same domain name and protocol(http or https) as your Wordpress site. In other words, if your Wordpress site is hosted at "https://my-wordpress-site.com" you can't use "http://my-wordpress-site.com" or "https://www.my-wordpress-site.com" or any other variation.

= I have another question, what do I do? =

Contact us anytime! If you ever need a question, you can email us at [support@wishpond.com](mailto://support@wishpond.com "Wishpond Support") or just use the live chat available to you directly through this plugin!
